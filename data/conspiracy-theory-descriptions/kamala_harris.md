The _Kamala_ _Harris_ conspiracy theory suggest that Vice president Kamal Harris 
is not eligible to be Vice President or President due to her alleged ineligibility as a natural-born citizen.
Some claim that because her parents were immigrants (her mother from India and her father from Jamaica), 
she does not meet the constitutional requirement of being a natural-born citizen. However, 
this theory has been thoroughly debunked, as Harris was born on American soil in Oakland, California.

On top of this Jones has accused Harris of being involved in a variety of other conspiracies, including connections to deep state operatives, 
support for radical left-wing ideologies, and being part of alleged plans for gun confiscation and the dismantling of the Second Amendment.
