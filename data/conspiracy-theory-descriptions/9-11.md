There are multiple conspiracy theories ranking around the [2001 9/11][9-11]
terrorist attacks where Al-Qaeda operatives crashed hijacked planes into the
World Trade Center twin towers in New York City and the Pentagon in
Washington, D.C.
These theories include, among others,

* foreknowledge by official authorities and stock traders,
* an inside job based on the claim that the impact of the planes alone could
  not have caused a collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers,
* the involvement of foreign governments such as the Israeli or Saudi-Arabian
  governments, and
* staging of the attacks by the US government to provide the government with
  arguments for the following invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.
