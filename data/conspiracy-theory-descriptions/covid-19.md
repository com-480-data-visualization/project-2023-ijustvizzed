The [_COVID-19_ pandemic][covid-19] starting in late 2019/early 2020 has caused
political actors (both political activists and government officials) world-wide
to spread a plethora of conspiracy theories.

These conspiracy theories include, among others,

* the accidental release of a bio-weapon,
* population control by global elites (see also: New World Order),
* accusation of religious minorities such as Jews or Muslims for spreading
  COVID-19,
* 5G mobile networks causing COVID-19,
* systematic overcounting of death counts,
* vaccines causing mutations in human DNA, and
* vaccines against COVID-19 containing tracking agents.
