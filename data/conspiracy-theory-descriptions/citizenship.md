The _Citizenship_ conspiracy theories affect multiple people, mainly former US
President [Barack Obama][obama] and current US Vice President
[Kamala Harris][harris].
Those conspiracy theories claim that the aforementioned US government officials
could have never gotten into office because they do not have the citizenship
of the United States of America.
The _Birther_ theories hypothesize that Obama was not actually born in the US
and that Harris does not posess the US citizenship due to her parents being
non-citizen immigrants at the time of birth.
