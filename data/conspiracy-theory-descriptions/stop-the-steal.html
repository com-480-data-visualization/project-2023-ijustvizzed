<p><em>Stop the Steal</em> (also referred to as the <em>Big Lie</em> by opponents to the theory) is a conspiracy theory heavily promoted by Donald Trump after the 2020 US presidential election. The theory claims widespread election fraud to the advantage of Joe Biden, finally leading to Donald Trump’s loss of the election. The spread of this conspiracy theory among right-wing extremists culminated in the attack on the Capitol on January 06 2021 where rioters tried to interrupt the Congressional proceedings confirming Joe Biden’s success in the presidential election.</p>
